		<h3>Let's take a look at them in detail. </h3>
	</div>

    <div class="type-1">
        <p>Watch the video below to understand:</p>

        <h3>1. Arithmetic Operators: </h3>
        <p>They are used to perform simple arithmetic operations on primitive data types. </p>
        <p>* : Multiplication <br>
            / : Division <br>
            % : Modulo <br>
            + : Addition <br>
            – : Subtraction</p>
    </div>

    <div class="type-2" id="UnaryOperators">
        <h3>2. Unary Operators:</h3>
        <p>Unary operators need only one operand. They are used to increment, decrement or negate a value. </p>
        <p>– : Unary minus, used for negating the values. <br>
            + : Unary plus indicates the positive value (numbers are positive without this, however). <br> It performs an automatic conversion to int when the type of its operand is the byte, char, or short. <br> This is called unary numeric promotion.
            <br> ++ : Increment operator, used for incrementing the value by 1. There are two varieties of increment operators. <br>
            Post-Increment: Value is first used for computing the result and then incremented. <br>
            Pre-Increment: Value is incremented first, and then the result is computed.
            <br> — : Decrement operator, used for decrementing the value by 1. There are two varieties of decrement operators. <br>
            Post-decrement: Value is first used for computing the result and then decremented. <br>
            Pre-Decrement: Value is decremented first, and then the result is computed.
            <br> ! : Logical not operator, used for inverting a boolean value.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="type-3" id="AssignmentOperator">
        <h3>3. Assignment Operator:</h3>
        <p>'=' Assignment operator is used to assign a value to any variable. It has a right to left associativity, <br> i.e. value given on the right-hand side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left, and therefore right-hand side <br> value must be declared before using it or should be a constant. </p>
        <p>The general format of the assignment operator is:</p>
        <p>variable = value;</p>

        <p>In many cases, the assignment operator can be combined with other operators to build a shorter version of the statement <br> called a Compound Statement. For example, instead of a = a+5, we can write a += 5. </p>
        <p>+=, for adding left operand with right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            -=, for subtracting right operand from left operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            *=, for multiplying left operand with right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            /=, for dividing left operand by right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            %=, for assigning modulo of left operand by right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="type-4" id="RelationalOperators">
        <h3>4. Relational Operators:</h3>
        <p> These operators are used to check for relations like equality, greater than, less than. They return boolean results after the <br> comparison and are extensively used in looping statements as well as conditional if-else statements. </p>
        
        <p>The general format is:</p>
        <p>variable relation_operator value</p>
        <p>Some of the relational operators are -</p>
        <p>==, Equal to: returns true if the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side. <br>
            !=, Not Equal to: returns true if the left-hand side is not equal to the right-hand side. <br>
            <, Less than: returns true if the left-hand side is less than the right-hand side. <br>
            <=, Less than or equal to returns true if the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side. <br>
            >, Greater than: returns true if the left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side. <br>
            >=, Greater than or equal to: returns true if the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right-hand side.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="type-5" id="LogicalOperators">
        <h3>5. Logical Operators:</h3>
        <p>These operators are used to perform “logical AND” and “logical OR” operations, i.e., the function similar to AND gate and OR gate <br> in digital electronics. One thing to keep in mind is the second condition is not evaluated if the first one is false, i.e., <br> it has a short-circuiting effect. Used extensively to test for several conditions for making a decision. <br> Java also have “Logical NOT”, it returns true when condition is false and vice-versa.</p>
        <p>The general format of the assignment operator is:</p>
        <p>variable = value;</p>

        <p>In many cases, the assignment operator can be combined with other operators to build a shorter version of the statement <br> called a Compound Statement. For example, instead of a = a+5, we can write a += 5. </p>
        <p>+=, for adding left operand with right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            -=, for subtracting right operand from left operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            *=, for multiplying left operand with right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            /=, for dividing left operand by right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            %=, for assigning modulo of left operand by right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="type-6" id="TernaryOperator">
        <h3>6. Ternary operator:</h3>
        <p>Ternary operator is a shorthand version of the if-else statement. It has three operands and hence the name ternary.</p>
        <p>The general format is:</p>
        <p>condition ? if true : if false</p>

        <p>In many cases, the assignment operator can be combined with other operators to build a shorter version of the statement <br> called a Compound Statement. For example, instead of a = a+5, we can write a += 5. </p>
        <p>+=, for adding left operand with right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            -=, for subtracting right operand from left operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            *=, for multiplying left operand with right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            /=, for dividing left operand by right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left. <br>
            %=, for assigning modulo of left operand by right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="type-7" id="BitwiseOperators">
        <h3>7. Bitwise Operators: </h3>
        <p>These operators are used to perform the manipulation of individual bits of a number. They can be used with any of the integer types. <br> They are used when performing update and query operations of the Binary indexed trees. </p>

        <p>&, Bitwise AND operator: returns bit by bit AND of input values. <br>
            |, Bitwise OR operator: returns bit by bit OR of input values. <br>
            ^, Bitwise XOR operator: returns bit by bit XOR of input values. <br>
            ~, Bitwise Complement Operator: This is a unary operator which returns the one's complement representation of <br> the input value, i.e., with all bits inverted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="type-8" id="ShiftOperators">
        <h3>8. Shift Operators:</h3>
        <p>These operators are used to shift the bits of a number left or right, thereby multiplying or dividing the number by two, <br> respectively. They can be used when we have to multiply or divide a number by two. </p>
        <p>General format:</p>
        <p>number shift_op number_of_places_to_shift;</p>

        <p> &#10094;&#10094;, Left shift operator: shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result. Similar effect as of multiplying <br> the number with some power of two. <br>
            &#10095;&#10095;, Signed Right shift operator: shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The leftmost <br> bit depends on the sign of the initial number. Similar effect as of dividing the number with some power of two. <br>
            &#10095;&#10095;&#10095;, Unsigned Right shift operator: shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. <br> The leftmost bit is set to 0.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="type-9" id="InstanceOfOperator">
        <h3>9. instanceof operator: </h3>
        <p>The instance of the operator is used for type checking. It can be used to test if an object is an instance of a class, <br> a subclass, or an interface.</p>
        <p>General format:</p>
        <p>object instance of class/subclass/interface</p>
    </div>

		<h3>Precedence and Associativity of Operators</h3>
	</div>

    <div class="textaftertypes">
        <p>Precedence and associative rules are used when dealing with hybrid equations involving more than <br> one type of operator. In such cases, these rules determine which part of the equation to consider first, <br> as there can be many different valuations for the same equation. The below table depicts the precedence <br> of operators in decreasing order as magnitude, with the top representing the highest precedence and <br> the bottom showing the lowest precedence.</p>

        <h2>#2 Variables.</h2>

        <p>Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program execution. <br> Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. Variable is a memory location <br> name of the data.
        </p>

        <p>A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.</p>

        <ul class="variables-bullets">
            <li>The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.</li>
            <li>A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.</li>
            <li>In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.</li>

        <h2>#3 Loops.</h2>

        <p>Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly <br> while some condition evaluates to true. Java provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar <br> basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.

        <h2>#4 Arrays.</h2>

        <p>An array in Java is a group of like-typed variables referred to by a common name. Arrays in Java work differently than <br> they do in C/C++. Following are some important points about Java arrays. 
        </p>

        <ul class="arrays-bullets">
            <li>In Java, all arrays are dynamically allocated.</li>
            <li>Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using the object property length. <br> This is different from C/C++, where we find length using sizeof.
            </li>
            <li>A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.</li>
            <li>The variables in the array are ordered, and each has an index beginning from 0.</li>
            <li>Java array can be also be used as a static field, a local variable, or a method parameter.</li>
            <li>The size of an array must be specified by int or short value and not long.</li>
            <li>The direct superclass of an array type is Object.</li>
            <li>Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            An array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) and object (or non-primitive) references of a class depending on the definition <br> of the array. In the case of primitive data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations. In the case of class <br> objects, the actual objects are stored in a heap segment.

        <h2>#5 Strings.</h2>
    
        <p>Strings in Java are Objects that are backed internally by a char array. Since arrays are immutable(cannot grow), <br> Strings are immutable as well. Whenever a change to a String is made, an entirely new String is created.

        <p>As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. <br> Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. <br> The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part <br> of the code can access this data except that function.
